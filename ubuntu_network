  There is something about the network problem of ubuntu:

  network manager and the wicd:

  one of then should installed ...

  but if you used dsl ... may be wicd will not suport ...

  so if you there is something wrong with network ... 

  install the other one of them that you has not installed and reinsall the one you prefert again to solve some strange problem...
